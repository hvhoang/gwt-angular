    GWT Angular brings the powerful MVC framework of AngularJS to the Java
    developers. By using GWT Angular, the user can take advantage of the 
    build-time optimization of GWT together with the runtime efficiency of 
    AngularJS.

    In this tutorial, we will create a simple client-only application, using
    GWT Angular. The application will be <i>client-only</i>, meaning that even
    though the application is written in Java language, there is no server-side
    component in the final output. The resulting application can be deployed
    to a web server, such as <a href="http://projects.apache.org/projects/http_server.html">
    Apache HTTP Server</a>. Because the output of GWT is a set of JavaScripts, 
    HTML, and other static resources, the entier application will run in the end
    user's browser. You will not need any JVM to run the final compiled output 
    of this application (though you will need one to do the development, if you
    decide to follow through the steps).

    You can see and interact with the panel, which contains this application
    below.

    Basic knowledge of Java and GWT is assumed. If you are not familiar with
    Java, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/">The Java Tutorials</a>
    is a good place to start. If you are not familiar with GWT, then please go
    over <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/">GWT Tutorial</a>
    before attempting to follow this tutorial.

    If you have never worked with AngularJS, that should not preclude you from
    being able to follow this tutorial. However, you should at be familiar with
    basic HTML and JavaScript programming concepts, as well as well known design
    patterns, such as Model View Control. I have found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">
    w3schools</a> an excellent source of HTML and JavaScript programming, and
    at minimum you can skim through the Wiki page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">
    AngularJS</a> before you start.

    In this tutorial, we will use Apache Maven to manage the project dependency,
    and use Eclipse for IDE. Strictly speaking, these things are not necessary,
    but if you plan to follow along the steps in tutorial, you may want to 
    install and configure these tools as well.
  </p><p>
    You can find information about Maven at <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">
    Apache Maven</a> website, and you can learn about Eclipse at the <a
    href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipese Foundation</a> website.

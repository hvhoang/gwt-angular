  <h1>MVC, The Angular Way</h1>
  <p>
    AngularJS, in a nut shell, is an MVC (Model View Controller) framework for 
    the web. It allows the view components to be written in plain old HTML, and 
    the Controllers and the Model in JavaScript. The framework takes care of 
    the binding between the view, controller, and the model, such that the DOM 
    events from the HTML are easily bound to the Controllers, and the change to 
    the Model are automatically reflected in the View.
  </p><p>
    The basic plumbing is handled by the framework under the hood, so that the 
    application developers can focus on providing the implementation for view, 
    controller, and model components, rather than spending time and energy on 
    the coordination of these components.
  </p><p>
    AngularJS expects that the developers using the framework be somewhat 
    familiar with JavaScript language. While neither HTML or JavaScript are 
    difficult languages to learn, they are, in particular, JavaScript is, 
    difficult to become an expert in.
  </p><p>
    This is where GWT Angular steps in. GWT Angular fuses GWT (Google Web 
    Toolkit) and AngularJS, so that the views can be written in HTML, while the 
    controllers can be written in Java language.
  </p><p>
    Java language is a high structured, self-documenting programming language. 
    While it lacks the agility and flexibility of JavaScript, it makes up for 
    that by enforcing structure, which makes it a more difficult language to 
    write poorly written code. This may not seem like a high praise, but it is 
    invaluable for large enterprise projects where the skill levels of the 
    developers on the team are often mixed, and the project must exchange hands 
    many times over time.
  </p><p>
    GWT is an open source web application development toolkit, originally 
    developed by Google. It comes with a compiler which compiles Java source 
    code into a cross-browser compatible, minified, obfuscated JavaScript. This 
    enables the developers to program web browsers using IDEs and tools 
    commonly available for Java language.
  </p><p>
    With GWT Angular, thanks to AngularJS and GWT, the developers do not have 
    to implement any complex DOM manipulation from often fragile JavaScript. 
    There is no need to worry about the JavaScript minifiers breaking the 
    application in production. The verbose and structured nature of Java 
    language makes long term maintenance of large and complex code suitable in 
    an enterprise setting.

  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h4>How is GWT Angular different from Java Applet?</h4>
  <p>
    GWT Angular does not require Java Plugin to be installed into the end 
    users' browser for it to function. The code written in Java is compiled 
    into cross-browser compatible JavaScript, so that it can be loaded directly
    into the browser.
  </p>

  <h4>Do we need to install JRE on end users' computers?</h4>
  <p>
    No. GWT Angular compiles into JavaScript, so that end users do not need to
    install JRE (Java Runtime Environment) on their machines.
  </p>

  <h4>Do we need a JEE server to host applications written using GWT Angular?</h4>
  <p>
    No. GWT Angular compiles into JavaScript. Any plain old web servers that
    serves HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc, can host applications written using GWT
    Angular.
  </p>
  
  <h4>If it compiles the code into JavaScript, and runs in the browser, then 
  why do we need to write the code in JavaScript?</h4>
  <p>
    You can write your code in JavaScript if you wish, but then you will not 
    need to use GWT Angular for that. We suggest that you look into using 
    <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> directly.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Can we use Spring Framework with GWT Angular?</h4>
  <p>
    No. Spring Framework is a server-side technology, and requires JRE. GWT 
    Angular is a client-side technology that is compiled into JavaScript and 
    runs on a JavaScriptEngine (web browser). If you are looking for a 
    dependency injection framework for client-side, we suggest you look into 
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-gin/">GIN (GWT INjection)</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h4>I currently use GWT. Why should I bother looking at GWT Angular?</h4>
  <p>
    GWT does not come with a straight forward MVC framework. You can try 
    writing a large GWT application following 
    <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/mvp-architecture.html">GWT's
    recommended MVP (Model View Presenter)</a>, if you wish, but we found
    AngularJS to be far more elegant, and application written with AngularJS to 
    be easier to maintain.
  </p>
  
  <h4>GWT offers UI Binder. Why should I write the code in HTML?</h4>
  <p>
    This was one of the reasons why we started to work on GWT Angular. We <i>
    wanted</i> to write the view code in HTML, <i>instead</i> of UI Binder. 
    While we recognize that UI Binder is a powerful extension to GWT, it 
    invents a whole new mark-up language. HTML is easy to learn, and many 
    people coming into application development already know it. Writing the 
    view code in HTML also means GWT Angular can be used with HTML/CSS based 
    responsive UI frameworks, such as Twitter's 
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, and there is a possibility
    of integrating GWT Angular with WYSIWYG HTML editors in the future.

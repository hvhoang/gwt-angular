  <p>
    GWT Angular supports promise pattern via Java wrapper around AngularJS's
    promise framework, which is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">
    Kris Kowal's Q</a>.
  </p><p>
    The below example demonstrates how two asynchronous calls are coordinated
    by a third, which depends on the outcome of the first two. Promise pattern
    makes it easy to establish pipelines of asynchronous calls without having to
    write a complex sequence of nested callbacks.
  </p><p>
    When you click the "Go" button below, first, the user is warned that he must
    wait for 1 second to see the outcome of his action. The user's action kicks
    off two asynchronous calls, one generates the salutation, "Hello", and the
    other generates the name, "World". These two asynchronous calls take 
    different amount of time to complete. There is a third call, which takes the
    results of salutation and name, and formats a greeting. The greeting message
    is then displayed to the screen.
  </p>
  
  <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-body" data-ng-include="DEMO_URL"></div>
  </div>
  
  <h2>View</h2>
  <p>
    The view code is straight forward, and has no knowledge of controller's 
    implementation and its asynchronous nature. It assumes that the greeting
    data is or will be provided, hence it calls <code>{{ getGreeting }}</code>
    method on the controller to obtain the value to print to the screen.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="VIEW_CODE"></pre>

  <h2>Controller</h2>
  <p>
    Controller takes no action onload, but when the user clicks the "Go" button,
    it invokes <code>onClickGo()</code> method. This method first updates the
    greeting caption on screen, letting the user know that the loading of the
    data is in progress. Then the method goes on to invoke the <code>getGreeting()
    </code> method of <code>GreetingService</code> object.
  </p><p>
    This service object is something we wrote for the purpose of demonstrating
    the promise pattern in GWT Angular. We will look at the implementation of
    this service class shortly, but for now, we'll focus on the handling of
    the <code>Promise&lt;String&gt;</code> object returned by this service call.
  </p><p>
    The returned object is a promise that, when the promised value is ready, it
    would invoke the callback object that you register with this promise object.
    In this case, what it promises is that the object of type <code>String</code>
    will be returned, signifying the greeting value.
  </p><p>
    We pass three different callback to this promise. First callback we pass is
    the <code>Done</code> object. This object receives the greeting value, and
    updates the screen caption with this value. The second callback is <code>
    Notify</code> object, which listens to the progress of asynchronous calls
    and updates the screen to let the user know of the progress. The third 
    callback is the <code>Fail</code>, which displays an error message on the
    screen if and when the promise fails to deliver the value.
  </p><p>
    In short, the controller merely knows how to consume the promise value, if
    and when it is delivered. It does not know any details about how the values
    are obtained.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="CONTROLLER_CODE"></pre>

  <h2>Service</h2>    
  <p>
    <code>GreetingService</code> is the code that handles the complexity of
    asynchronously loading the necessary data from the back-end. In this 
    example, we decided to simulate asynchronous loading of the data rather than
    actually setting up live web services. This is because we wanted to focus
    on the promise and resolution of the values in the browser, and did not
    want to distract you with the design and implementation of web service code.
  </p><p>
    There are three public methods in this service, <code>getGreeting()</code>,
    which you have already seen being called from the controller, and two others,
    <code>getName()</code> and <code>getSalutation()</code>. All three public
    methods return an object of type <code>Promise</code>.
  </p><p>
    <code>getSalutation()</code> method simulates an asynchronous call by using
    a <code>Timer</code> class in GWT. It schedule a job to run in 1 second,
    which returns a string value "Hello" by calling the <code>resolve()</code>
    method on the <code>Deferred</code> object obtained from <code>Q</code>.
  </p><p>
    <code>getName()</code> method also simulates an asynchronous call by using
    a <code>Timer</code> class in GWT. It schedule a job to run in 0.5 seconds,
    which returns a string value "World" by calling the <code>resolve()</code>
    method on the <code>Deferred</code> object obtained from <code>Q</code>.
  </p><p>
    Note that neither of the <code>getSalutaion()</code> or <code>getName()</code>
    methods are blocking, in a sense that the caller does not have to wait for
    these promised string values to become available. They simply return the 
    <code>Promise</code> values, so that the caller can later retrieve these
    values whenever they become available.
  </p><p>
    You may recall that the controller for this demo does not call these two
    service methods we have so far talked about, but the controller calls the
    <code>getGreeting()</code> method. Let's take a look at it now.
  </p><p>
    <code>getGreeting()</code> method uses <code>q.all()</code> service method
    of type <code>Q</code>, which is injected by AngularJS into our custom
    service class. This method allows the parallel execution of promises, and
    returns another single promise to be resolved when all promises are ready.
  </p><p>
    The concept of parallel execution is rather important. If we had executed
    these three asynchronous calls in series, then the execution time of the 
    entire pipeline would have been 1.5 seconds. But because we execute them
    in parallel, we can execute them in 1 second, which is the slower of the
    two promises that the <code>getGreeting()</code> depends on.
  </p><p>
    The purpose of <code>getGreeting()</code> method is to construct a new 
    greeting object, given the values of salutation and name. It knows how to
    construct this new value, but it does not have to know anything about how
    these values are loaded.

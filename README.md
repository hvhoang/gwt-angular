| 0.0.x |The interface is still volatile. From build to build, any interfaces may be removed without any prior notice. |
| 0.1.x | The public interface is frozen. Deprecated interfaces will be annotated prior to removal in v0.2. |
| 0.x.x |Any subsequent releases with minor version (the second numeral) increase indicate that the interfaces previously deprecated may be removed. |
| 1.0.0-alpha.x | The API will become available for early preview. |
| 1.0.0-beta.x  | The API will become available for beta testing. |


Collaborators Wanted
====================
Although I have many years of Java and GWT development experience, my understanding of AngularJS is na√Øve at best. If any AngularJS experts out there who can help me understand the core design philosophy of this powerful framework, please let me know. I can use your help.

You may have figured out that this is a one-man project started in his kitchen (I do not have a garage). There is no corporate sponsor behind this project.


Getting Started
===============

### Building the project
You will need the following build and package management tools to build GWT Angular project.

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [bower](http://bower.io)
* jdk
* [maven](http://maven.apache.org)

Install bower if you have not done so yet.

```
npm install -g bower
```

If you are running the above command from a restricted account, and, if you do have access to privileged account, you may have to execute the above command using `sudo`.

Set up maven on your machine, and then execute the following commands to build the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/kyoken74/gwt-angular.git
cd gwt-angular
mvn clean install
```

Overview
========
The purpose of gwt-angular project is to bring the powerful MVC framework of AngularJS to Java programmers.

gwt-angular provides a GWT wrapper around AngularJS, so that the controller component of AngularJS can be written in Java language, in a manner that is natural to a programmer with little background in JavaScript but with more experience in Java. gwt-angular aims to bridge the gap in paradigm.

The purpose of gwt-angular is to introduce a clear separation between the view and controller for GWT developers, which has been a challenge. The views are intended to be written in HTML/CSS, and, as such, gwt-angular does not provide any view components (i.e. widgets) in Java. The users are encouraged to explorer various HTML based view frameworks.

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)

*Note that while gwt-angular project uses the products provided by above projects, gwt-angular itself is not affiliated with the above projects.*

    GWT Angular allows the users to write the <i>filter</i> code in Java.
    In this example, we write a <code>ReverseFilter</code>, which takes a
    string, and simply reverses the order so that the entire string appears
    backwards. It is important to note that this filter does not modify the
    underlying model. The original string remains "as is" while the filter
    only formats the string on the screen.

  <h2>Filter</h2>
  <p>
    In order to define your own filter, you must extend an abstract class named
    <code>AbstractFilter</code> and provide an implementation for the method
    <code>filter(String)</code>. The argument is the original model, and the
    returned string is the formatted string that appears on the screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you create a custom filter, such as ReverseFilter, you must register 
    it with your module. In this example, we let the GWT Angular figure out the
    name for this filter. By default, the filter name is the same as the class
    name, except that the first letter is not capitalized, i.e. "Reverse" 
    becomes "reverse".
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="CUSTOM_FILTER_MODULE"></pre>

  <h2>View</h2>
  <p>
    Using this filter in the view is easy. You can simply use the broken pipe
    <code>|</code> between the model and the filter (where model in this 
    example is returned by <code>getCaption()</code> and the custom filter, of
    course, being the <code>reverse</code>. The filter should be place to the
    right of the model you wish to process.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="CUSTOM_FILTER_VIEW"></pre>
  <p>
    Note that the use of filter does not alter the state of the underlying 
    model. In another words, if you inspect the value of the <code>caption</code>
    variable in the controller after the filter is evaluated in the view, the
    model will still show "Hello, World!", and not the "!dlroW ,olleH".

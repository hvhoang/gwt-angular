    GWT Angular wraps AngularJS's mechanism for defining directives, so that the
    directives can be defined in Java language. We demonstrate this feature
    with a simple "hello" directive, which prints out a text "Hello, World!" to
    the screen.

  <div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-body" data-ng-include="DEMO_URL"></div>
  </div>
  
  <h2>View</h2>
  <p>
    In order to print the above code, here is the HTML mark-up that was used.
    The important bit, of course, is the inner <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> with
    the directive <code>data-my-hello</code>. If you are familiar with 
    AngularJS, or you have been following the other examples for GWT Angular,
    you must be familiar by now that all AngularJS directives start with
    <code>data-ng-*</code>. The directive shown here, however, has the prefix
    of <code>data-ng-my-*</code>.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="view"></pre>

  <h2>Directive</h2>
  <p>
    Let's take a look at the Java code that was written to support this 
    directive.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="directive"></pre>
  <p>
    In order to define a custom directive, you must implement GWT Angular's
    <code>Directive</code> interface, for which there is a convenient abstract
    class <code>AbstractDirective</code> that you can extend if you do not wish
    to configure every aspect of your directive and only focus on the bits that
    you care about. In this example, we will only implement the method <code>
    getTemplate()</code> which returns an HTML fragment of type <code>
    TextResource</code> that is automatically inserted into the view when the 
    directive is evaluated. 
  </p><p>
    Instead of hard-coding the HTML mark-up into the Java code, <code>
    ClientBundle</code> allows us to separate the mark-up language into its
    own file, outside of Java code. This will make much cleaner and maintainable
    code if and when the complexity of the template used for the directive
    increases.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Template</h2>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="template"></pre>
  <p>
    The template HTML for this example is shown above. This is the content of
    <code>MyHello.html</code> that was bound to the Java code via <code>
    MyHelloResource</code> interface's <code>template()</code> method.
  </p><p>
    There is one variable that is being evaluated in this template, 
    <code>myHello</code>. This variable is automatically configured by the
    GWT Angular. GWT Angular (unlike AngularJS) automatically assigns the value
    of the directive, in this example, the returned value from the <code>
    getName()</code> method of <code>CustomDirectiveExampleController</code>,
    to a variable of the same name as the directive.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Controller</h2>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="controller"></pre>

  <h2>Module</h2>
  <p>
    Of course, both the directive and controller code must be registered with an
    Angular module, e.g.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="module"></pre>
  <p>
    We need to clarify what we mean by the "name of the directive." In the view
    code, we used the directive <code>data-my-hello</code>, but inside the 
    template, we used the Angular variable <code>myHello</code>, which we said,
    was the same name as the directive. Further more, the name of the Java
    class implementing the directive is named <code>MyHello.java</code>.
  </p><p>
    This all derives from the AngularJS's directive naming practice. AngularJS
    dictates that the "name" of a directive should be camelCase, such that 
    every word-break is capitalized and the first letter must be lower case.
    So, GWT Angular takes the simple name of the Java class, e.g. <code>
    MyHello</code>, which almost fits this rule, and converts the first letter
    to the lower case to derive the name, <code>myHello</code> automatically.
    The user can use the directive in the HTML with dash-delimited version of 
    the same name. In this case, <code>my-hello</code>. The reason we use <code>
    data-my-hello</code> is so that the HTML editors do not flag them as invalid
    attributes. The expressions <code>my-hello</code> and <code>data-my-hello
    </code> are equivalent at runtime.
  </p><p>
    Of course, if we did not like the name GWT Angular assigns you directive,
    you can override it by explicitly passing the name of the directive at the
    time you register the component to your module. 
  </p>

  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    The following modules are required in the gwt.xml.
  </p>
  <pre data-gwt-prettify="config"></pre>

  <p>
    The following Maven dependencies are required in the pom.xml.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.asayama.gwt&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;gwt-angular-ng&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;{{ GWT_ANGULAR_VERSION }}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>

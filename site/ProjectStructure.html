    Unlike a pure JavaScript project, which takes no time to get started, GWT,
    like any other Java projects, requires some setting up to do to get started.
    For this tutorial, we will use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>
    to manage the build and artifacts. The project will follow 
    <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">
    Maven project structure.</a>
  </p><p>
    One thing we should note in this project is that the <code>webapp</code>
    directory is under <code>src/test</code>. This is because there is really
    nothing in that directory we need in our build output. Because this
    application is a <i>client-only</i> application, there are not server-side
    components to store in this directory. The <code>web.xml</code> we find here
    is there to support Hosted Mode for testing.
  </p><p>
    Shown all the way at the bottom of the directory structure, you will find a
    file named <code>pom.xml</code>. This is a Maven project descriptor. You
    will find more information about in the next chapter, 
    <a href="#!tutorial?page=projectObjectModel">Project Object Model</a>.

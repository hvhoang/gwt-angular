<h1>GWT Angular is not supported on IE8</h1>
<p>
  IE8 is an older browser, which does not conform to the modern technology
  standards. The usage of IE8 has been in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_explorer.asp">
  steady decline</a>. AngularJS, the framework on which GWT Angular is based, is
  <a href="http://blog.angularjs.org/2013/12/angularjs-13-new-release-approaches.html">
  dropping IE8 support starting their 1.3 release</a>.
</p><p>
  In theory, it is possible to fork GWT Angular into two branches, Angular 
  1.2.x branch and future 1.3.x branch to continue IE8 support in one of the 
  branches, but given that GWT Angular is a one-man operation at this time 
  (which I hope will change in the future), there is really not enough resources
  to maintain two branches simultaneously.

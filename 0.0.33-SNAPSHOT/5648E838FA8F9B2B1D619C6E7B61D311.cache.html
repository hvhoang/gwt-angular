    To see this example in action, try typing in something into the text field
    below. Before you enter any values into the field, the caption above the
    field should read "<b>{{ GREETING }}, {{ STRANGER }}!</b>" Once you enter
    a value in the field, e.g. "Jack", then you will see that caption updated
    to "<b>{{ GREETING }}, Jack!</b>" as you type in the value.

    A text <code>&lt;INPUT&gt;</code> field is associated with an Angular 
    model called <code>name</code> using <code>data-ng-model</code> directive.
    When the element is first rendered, the controller's 
    <code>getName()</code> is called and the value is from this method is 
    assigned to the model. When the value of the input box is changed, the
    change is communicated to the controller via <code>data-ng-change</code>
    directive, which calls <code>setName()</code> method.

    The controller code bound to the view above is shown below. The view 
    communicates with the controller via the <code>getName()</code> and 
    <code>setName()</code> methods.
  </p><p>
    There are two other variables that are defined in this controller that 
    are bound to the view. They are <code>GREETING</code> and <code>STRANGER
    </code>. You may recognize these variables from the HTML code above.
    These public final constants are bound to the view, so that they can be
    inserted into the view via the use of double mustache notation, {{ }}.
